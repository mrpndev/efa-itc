# Intro to Code

This is the unofficial (for now) walk through for Eleven Fifty Academy's Introduction to Coding course.
If it's your first time doing one, fear not. If you follow the following outline, you will look like a pro doing it!

There are a few tips to follow before we begin:
- [ ] Make sure you read through everything before start.
- [ ] Do not assume your team is there! Always check everyone is in the room.
- [ ] Make sure you have links to all of the rooms you will be using.
- [ ] Everything that can go wrong will go wrong. Be prepared!

 Enough talk. Let's look at the outline of a successful ITC. 

* Let all of your support staff and give co-host priviledges. This should be done 15 mins prior to start time.
* As you prepare the links below, make sure that you "share sound" in Zoom when you begin sharing your screen.
* As you click "admit all", [begin playing videos from this slide deck.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XHyrfcu6lDDMrgCdFty1LdZXyoyhCZmQNwia10vFHTk/edit?usp=sharing)

* Introduce yourself, then softly pass it on to the rest of your team.
* Discuss what we will be doing today.
* This includes letting guests know that we will be splitting between Code, UX|UI, and Cybersecurity.
* Soft transition into introducing Admissions.
* Begin coding with hourly ten minute breaks.
* Question time until class is no longer interested.
